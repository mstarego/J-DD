public class Battle {
// This would get instantiated whenever there was a battle sequence. You would pass in an array of players
// and an array of monsters, and probably and array of NPCs.  Each player, monster, and NPC would get a turn
// to determine what it does in the fight.  Would have to check for keyboard input to determine if the player
// retreats, casts a spell, switches weapons, etc.  Each monster and NPC would also get a turn for each of 
// those actions also.
//
// Testing git with this comment - master branch.
//
// Adding this line from github website.  See if it will pull down into Eclipse from Eclipse app.
// 
// A line added within the John-test-branch-1 branch.  This will be merged into master.
