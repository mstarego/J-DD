public class Battle {
// This would get instantiated whenever there was a battle sequence. You would pass in an array of players
// and an array of monsters, and probably and array of NPCs.  Each player, monster, and NPC would get a turn
// to determine what it does in the fight.  Would have to check for keyboard input to determine if the player
// retreats, casts a spell, switches weapons, etc.  Each monster and NPC would also get a turn for each of 
// those actions also.

// Testing git with this comment - master branch.
//
// Adding this line from github website.  See if it will pull down into Eclipse from Eclipse app.
// 
// A line added within the John-test-branch-1 branch.  This will be merged into master.
	
//Initiate method to startup and initiate the battle.
//	start method to start the battle
//	finish method to wrap up a battle, adjust player/monster settings etc.  determine winner. give gold.
//	There would be a player method called Fight where the player picks the fight with the moster.  inside
//	Fight method, the battle object would be created to conduct the fight.  Whoever the player picks the
//	fight with would be the parameter to Fight, which would be passed along to the battle object.
//	During the battle sequence, we would need to check for user input to change weapon, retreat, strike, cast
//	spell, self heal, etc.
//	We would need a way to fight multiple targets, perhaps multiple battle objects?  We could possibly
//	conduct battle against an array of targets in one battle object?  I think using multiple battle objects
//	would be the way to go.  The player could disengage from some of the targets and focus on a single 
//	monseter.  You would just then close out the battle objects of the monsters from which the player 
//	disengages.
